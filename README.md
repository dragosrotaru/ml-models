# ml-models

ML models implemented in Typescript, Rust and WebGPU

I intend to build this repo up with well documented models written from the perspective of a programmer,
rather than a ML researcher. This is to make it more accessible. I also want to reimplement the low level details
in a web native stack (TS, Rust via WASM, WebGPU) because that in itself is valuable.
And because I hate Python.
